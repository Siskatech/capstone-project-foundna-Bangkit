# Capstone-Project-Foundna-Bangkit

**What is FoundNa?** 

FoundNa is a capstone project developed as part of the Bangkit 2023 program. FoundNa's goal is to create a mobile application that helps users identify newly encountered animals using image recognition technology and mobile mobile platforms. This application aims to provide detailed information on the animals encountered and how to handle them, as well as help others in conducting research.

**Project Details**

The FoundNa project focuses on the following key aspects:
1. Image Recognition: FoundNa uses image recognition technology to identify animals based on images uploaded by users. This application uses a machine learning algorithm with the MobileNetV2 architecture as the base model and the Convocational Nural Network to analyze and match images with the available list and produce output in the form of detailed information and how to handle animals.
2. Matching Algorithm: FoundNa uses a matching algorithm to compare uploaded images with a database of lost items or pets. The algorithm identifies potential matches and presents them to the user, providing a list of potential matches ranked by relevance.
3. User Discovery: The application allows users to learn from the history of each user's discoveries regarding the animals they meet.
4. Online Shop: Users can purchase animal goods through the application.
